# Graph Traversal Use Cases

## Which traversal algorithm would be best for each situation? (BFS or DFS)

1) If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

2) If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, 

3) If the tree is very wide:

4) If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree

5) determining whether a path exists between two nodes

6) Finding the shortest path

## Answers
1) BFS
2) BFS (DFS will take longer)
3) DFS (BFS is too memory intensive for wide trees)
4) DFS
5) DFS
6) BFS
