//Google Question
//Given an array = [2,5,1,2,3,5,1,2,4]:
//It should return 2

//Given an array = [2,1,1,2,3,5,1,2,4]:
//It should return 1

//Given an array = [2,3,4,5]:
//It should return undefined

//Bonus... What if we had this:
// [2,5,5,2,3,5,1,2,4]
// return 5 because the pairs are before 2,2
